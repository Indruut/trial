    <h2>More about me</h2>
    <details>
<summary>My chilhood </summary>
<p> My sweetest memory: Waking up in the cold winter morning and through the window seeig huge snowflakes in the air, then smelling pancakes from the kitchen and knowing that mom is cooking breakfast and soon soon I will step in and will try heart shape pancakes from the wafle pan and on the top will put frozen smashed berries which were picked from the summer and kept in frozen camera for the mrnings like this. After that daddy will come back home from the weekend shoping in the supermarket. His arms will be storngly holding shopping bags, cheeks will be red from the cold weather and his warm jacket will be wet from the snow which was falling on him, then he will look at me and my sis, will smile and will tell: "THAT'S A REAL WINTER OUTSIDE, later if you will be good we can take sled and go outside to have fun". </p>
